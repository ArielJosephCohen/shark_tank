# Goals

Welcome to my project! The goal of this project is to determine what types of pitches are most likely to make a deal on the TV show Shark Tank. As one may or may not know, Shark Tank is an exciting reality show in which hopeful and budding entrepreneurs are given a unique opportunity to present their business to a group of proven and succesful entrepreneurs, known as the sharks. The sharks are a group of five (chosen from a constant pool of 6) who will spend time talking to each entrepreneur to get an understanding of all the things that matter when going into business with someone. If the sharks are impressed they will make an offer to join the business. At this point, the entrepreneurs looking for a deal have the option to either accept that deal or push for a better deal. Often times, entrepreneurs push their requests beyond what the sharks will commit to and may leave without a deal. So now that we know how this whole idea works, the goal of my project is to investigate 6 seasons worth of data to build a model and that will predict the success of an entrepreneur on the show in terms of getting a deal, and also identify leading indicators as to whether one may get a deal or not.
